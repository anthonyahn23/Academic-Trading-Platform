      <h2> How to Use this Site</h2>
      <p> The goal of this site is to provide a safe space for people looking to exchange resources, specifically tests and notes for the <a href="https://www.soinc.org/">Science Olympiad</a> competition.</p>
      <p>To get started, head over to the "Sign-up" page and set up an account. Then head to the "My Profile" page to set up and list what resources you're looking for, what resources you have, and what resources you are planning on getting.</p>
      <p>Then you can explore the "Find Traders" page to find other people's profiles and you can initiate a trade with that person. An online moderator with no connections to either individual will join the chat to make sure that the trade is honored and no harassment occurs.</p>
